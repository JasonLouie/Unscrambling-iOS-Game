# Unscrambling-iOS-Game
Unscramble! is a simple iOS game that encourages players to create as many words as they can from a randomized string of characters and can also teach them new words. After players create as many words as they can, they can choose to end the round and view their game statistics. This includes how many words they found/missed, their all time highest score, and the score they received for the previous round. Upon clicking words found or missed, the definitions, part of speeches, and sentence examples for a word are shown to the user. Players can even change the minimum and maximum possible length of the randomly generated string. This project was created on Xcode using Swift and it can only be opened on a Mac OS device with Xcode.
